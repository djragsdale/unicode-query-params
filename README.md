## Get it running

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then go to [/cart](/cart) to see the example. Go to [/cart?annual=✓&savings=¼&currency=€](/cart?annual=✓&savings=¼&currency=€) to see everything in action!

## Code style

We use [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) JavaScript style and combined with Prettier, using very few customized rules. The only deviations are there to minimize Git changes to the relevant lines.

## Contributing

I'll add a CONTRIBUTING.md eventually. Until then, allow the Husky pre-commit hook to run Prettier and Eslint fix on the code.
